          Hello there, I am Prasad Joshi.

        <p class="intro">
          I am currently a student. I like cooking and reading books once in a
          while, also finding convenient stuff online.

        <p class="intro">
          I have mainly made this website for people who keep asking "Hey, how
          did you do that?" way too many times. I hope to provide them with one
          stop solution for their needs, and maybe they will find something of
          interest as well.
